Pelican 3.0 is almost out the door now. It's been great working on a "real" project with other developers for, in retrospect, is the first time ever.

Some programmers I know would rather fork a project and trudge off into the snow, fork off their own leg, and write their way back before working on someone else's code; However I've found it downright pleasant. I realize that not every team is as friendly and constructive as the Pelican project has been but just the concept of check and balances and the feedback alone is invaluable.

The project has sidetracked several other of my side projects, but in one of the best ways possible I think. While cleaning out little bugs and documenting things over several times may not be everyone's best use of time; I feel getting used to have to test everything, double think my commits, write tests for everything is invaluable. On a personal project you can quickly develop and learn bad habits. Working with a team forces good habits, or at least as good habits as the team itself.

I still plan on learning more languages, namely lispâ€¦ but right now I am juggling working on this project and studying reversing, one of my biggest future interests. As a whole sidetrack I think that infosec is where I am going to steer my career and reversing and malware is my current big lead. If anything learning true low level computing and programming will help me understand all the other facets of security and infrastructure that much better. Not that technical management isn't a great career, but I don't feel it's really focusing me where I want to be long term.
