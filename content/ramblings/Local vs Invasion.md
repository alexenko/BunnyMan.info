I promise I won't use this site often as a personal mouthpiece for my opinion but since I am currently talking mostly about the goals, inspirations, and ideals behind this I thought I would offer this insight.

**Notice:** `The views and opinions in this post do not necessarily represent the opinions of Vegas Furry Arts. Also there is some foul language. Sorry. Once this site becomes for public use I will probably move this to my personal blog.`

## Problem
More than a few people in my time have asked what I have against Furry Conventions in Las Vegas. This is a misguided question because I don't have anything against FurCons in Vegas, I want one. I know people who really don't want one but I don't share their views, I respect them, but don't share them.

Then people ask, "Well then why did you run X out of town?" or "Well then why do you always step over any con that has tried to come into town?". That is the better question. The first answer, in short, is because some people I really respect absolutely positively do not want a furry con in town. Even thought they are heavily involved with the furry community they still live in the furry closet a large part of their life. They do this because they fear for their jobs or family lives if furry becomes to popular and they are found out to be involved in this; especially if bad PR is involved.

That really is just the cop out answer. The simple fact of the matter is with the growth of furry and conventions it's only a matter of time before it happens. The question is who will be doing it?

## Reaction
I think the title and header makes my opinion fairly clear cut on what my opinion is. It's the concept of local conventions vs invasions and everyone knows what side I am on. Most people won't know or care about the difference really… but the people effected usually care a lot.

Invasion cons happen when some people stop through a city as a tourist. They spend a few days in someone else's town and go, "Man this place is amazing! It has X and X and X and… we should totally through a con here". Then they start going at it. At some point they might start rounding up some willing locals to do some dirty work but in the end it's not like it was their idea so why should they get involved?

This is exactly like that one friend in high school, the one who always wanted to throw a party at _your_ house. Maybe not even yours, but someone else's house was always the party point in his mind. At some point do you have to wonder; Is it because the grass is always greener, your parents house was just that much more awesome, or was it because he knew that if the party was at your place he doesn't have to clean up the mess or deal with pissed off parents when it goes sideways.

Vegas draws in these types like no-one's business. We are an awesome place, 24 hour town, tourist friendly, convention space, and a ton of local furs. I mean why wouldn't you want to throw a con here? Oh! Except for the fact you can't fur suit in a casino, or on most of the strip, and minors aren't welcome either. When I say minors I mean in this town if you aren't 21 you are 12. Oh and casino's aren't small con or NPO friendly because they don't need the breaks, they support the large majority of all major paid conventions. When you actually start to dig into it this place kinda sucks for fur cons.

I wasn't always jaded against invasion cons but I haven't been pitched one or saw of one elsewhere I liked yet.

## Examples
> This is just a slice of what I have experienced while dealing with people who wanted to come into Vegas to throw a con. The names are removed but we all know the score.

### I really need the cash, and you do do everything for me, and by the by, fuck the locals.
This was the first person who came to town to throw a con. Wait… no this person never came to town. They made a long series of phone-calls to me asking the fledgling VegasFurs community to throw a con for them. They of course would be con chair since they have all the experience but since they are too busy to come to town they needed us to;

* Find some venues and get some base pricing
* Put together a small staff to handle the workload
* Put together some events, inside of the pre-chosen list
* Collect $X to get some downs and stuff started

Oh, but by the by, I know your community is 85% under 21 at the moment but my con needs to be adults only. You might be able to like sneak some of them in if they are willing to volunteer and be a runner but honestly it's too much a pain to deal with em. Fuck em. Also? I don't wanna put on a normal con, I want an upper crust con, full open bar and catered meals. Something where we charge $300 for admission and it's like a royal vacation treatment in vegas.

phtttt Awesome idea. All the people in vegas want that right?

### We're running out of backyards to shit in. Your town looks nice.
I don't think I need to elaborate on this. A con that had been bouncing around a few towns with a stream of drama-chum filled waters streaming behind them set their sights on vegas. A popular vote was no, go away. They of course started massive amounts of drama and tried to rally other locals against all those who didn't want them around.

### Screw the locals, let's just put on a con without telling anyone or how I learned to stop worrying and troll Vegas.
So after the last two attempts you can assume we were not in the mood for any more invasions… Then FC2010 happened. We learned about a new con being advertised called Antheria right outside of LA (I'll loop back around to this later) and also about PAFcon. Yep! Someone did shirts and started promotion for a Las Vegas Furry convention named after the very ill fated CSI con. You know the one, that one piece of PR that everyone would love to forget?

Needless to say that started a whole lot of butthurt in town. Honestly not only was that ballsy to have called it that but it seemed like a big jab at the greater of Las Vegas locals since no one in the town knew anything that ever went on. The site was a 2 minute drupal install and the whois records pointed back to the same people who hosted dramacon from above so it's hard not to look back and realize it that it was just a big troll. It worked for the most part, they got under some peoples skin; for the most part I was never too bothered but kept my eye on it. They advertised it going to happen for two years before the joke got old.

### Invasion in action
Now I know I wasn't mentioning names but Anafailia is gonna have to get called out as a staple that I can actually point a finger at and go "SEE! This is everything I was worried about." Antheria was a great idea on paper. Redondo beach is picturesque, tourist friendly, and is hardly hours off several major areas. However no one that lived there was throwing a con so some other people did.

What resulted… and yes, I was there, was two years of being run into the ground by sabotage and drama, a few PR gaffs and a half, a REALLY pissed off hotel or three, and ultra shitty attendance. The second year the place had something like 100 heads tops and I KNEW a ton of people were day tripping and ghosting. No one cared about the con because they weren't the locals. They walked up on someone else's territory and pissed on some shoes, then acted all indignant when they got run out.

People that had a good time even called it anifalia… it was a train wreck.

### The point
My point is that invasion cons are crap. Don't do it. If you can't pull off a con in your own town, then what makes you think doing it is someone else's makes is gonna make it that much better? Hell, if you CAN pull off a con in your town why don't you get to it? Do you think that by roping in all the locals in some other town is gonna make your life easier?

This brings me to the underlying POINT behind my whole problem with invasion cons. You clearly don't give a fuck, this is our town and you don't care, you just wanna be that guy, throwing your party in our back yard. You are picking one of the most hostile for youth towns in the US and going, "Hey! Booze and strippers and flashing lights! I need another excuse to go there… let's throw a con." Don't deny it, you ONLY picked us cause you want another Vegas Vacation, not because you give two shits about this community. I dare anyone to prove me different. None of these people that came in wanted an event for locals. They wanted an event staffed by locals, run for them, so they can enjoy more Vegas. Maybe they can even grab the fame of pulling off the next FC in the city of sin itself.

I'm not the king of Las Vegas or anything but don't you sound like a piece of crap when you look at it from our angle?

## Solution
So what's the solution? Well that's easy, the natives are restless and we need REAL events. Something that takes a day out of your weekend once a quarter or twice a year. Maybe a yearly event that is worth calling in your friends and giving all these invaders something to do in our town.

Everyone is happy at that point right?

I don't think it's going to be that simple. No one in town coming forward has the energy or fiscal backing to run a major event in town RIGHT NOW. Most of the community has been wrapped up in forums and stupid drama here and there. Also these invaders aren't going to be sated by a con oriented for the locals. They want tourist con in tourist town.

My hope is that Vegas Furry Arts can build it from the group up. This place needs a few PawFurs and NotACon's before we can consider having an FWA, or RainFurrest, or even a Further Confustion. I don't think we will ever manage to pull something like that off. Honestly I think Las Vegas needs a large attendance fur con like I need my brains spattered against a wall… and that's a hard statement to disagree with no matter what stance you take.
